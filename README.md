## Hi there 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at CTU (Czech Technical University) passionate about building clean, efficient and practical software.

### 🚀 What I Work On

* **Low-level programming** — learning C/C++ and understanding how things work under the hood.
* **Linux workflows** — improving efficiency with terminal tools and system structure.
* **Version control** — mastering Git for clean and maintainable development.
* **Web development** — currently building a web-based generator tool (details coming soon).
